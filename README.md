# Infosec-and-Hacking-Scripts  	:monocle_face: :nerd_face:

      Scripts are lists of commands executed by certain programs or scripting engines. 👌
      They are usually text documents with instructions written using a scripting language. 😜
      They are used to automate computer processes...ie attacks, automation and defenses, analysis....lets have fun! 😏

Introduction😄
------------
      This is a collection of scripts I USE while learning scripting and programming or used in pentests😉
      * I DO NOT claim ownership of all scripts...This is just a convenient collection of different scripts
      * written by different authors (including myself) for different scenarios in pentesting...A hackers Bible of some sort😄
